## Description

The Extended Isolation Forest algorithm is an advancement over traditional isolation forests, aimed at enhancing fault detection accuracy in SHPs by leveraging anomaly detection techniques. This repository includes:
- Preprocessed data files for training and testing,
- Implementation scripts for the isolation forest model, PCA, and KICA-PCA methods, and
- A results file that records the fault detection outputs based on the modelâ€™s analysis.

## Requirements

To run the scripts in this repository, ensure that you have the following software and packages installed:

- Python 3.7.6
- SciPy 1.4.1
- Scikit-learn 0.22.1
- Pandas 1.0.1
- NumPy 1.18.1
- Matplotlib 3.1.3
